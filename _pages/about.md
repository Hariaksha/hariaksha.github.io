Welcome to my website! I am a Boren and Gilman Research Scholar at the University of Alabama, studying Data Science and Foreign Languages and Literature. My research interests are in sustainable development, environmental economics, and peace and conflict. 

I have studied and worked at universities, nonprofits, and research institutions across the United States, Indonesia, and Germany. My past and current research projects have to do with environmental and human health, nonprofit strategy, and data protection policy. You can learn about my background and experiences on LinkedIn or through my resume.

Please have a low bar for [reaching out](mailto:hgunda@crimson.ua.edu) if anything piques your interest; I would love to hear from you.
