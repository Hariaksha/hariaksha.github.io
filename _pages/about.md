Welcome to my website! I am a Boren and Gilman Research Scholar at the University of Alabama, studying Data Science and Foreign Languages and Literature. I am training to obtain a PhD in Sustainable Development and apply tools from data science, mathematics, and economics to inform environmental policy and peacebuilding. My research interests are in sustainable development, environmental economics, and peace and conflict. 

My work is grounded in a belief in equity, curiosity, collaboration, and long-term responsibility to people and our planet. I believe that rigorous data, thoughtful policy, and emerging technologies should serve communities, and I am especially drawn to questions at the intersection of climate, conflict, and sustainable development. Collaboration and cultural exchange matter deeply to me, so I seek out spaces where diverse perspectives are welcomed and where I can help build bridges across disciplines, cultures, and institutions.

I have studied and worked at universities, nonprofits, and research institutions across the United States, Indonesia, and Germany. My past and current research projects have to do with environmental and human health, nonprofit strategy, and data protection policy. You can learn more about my background and experiences on LinkedIn or through my resume.

In my free time, I enjoy running, weightlifting, and reading, especially novels and nonfiction that explore politics, history, and society. I also love learning new languages, which helps me connect more deeply with the places I live and the people I meet. Together, my habits shape my sense of self as someone who is always training—physically, intellectually, and culturally—to show up better in my academic work and in my communities.

Please have a low bar for [reaching out](mailto:hgunda@crimson.ua.edu) if anything piques your interest; I would love to hear from you.
