The Flutter Book refers to a traditional binding style first developed during the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279 CE) of China. In this binding style, folios are glued (or taped, in this case) to create a fluttering effect when the book is opened. This contrasts with other styles of bookbinding, which use sewing to bind folios together. 

I found this type of book fun to hold and open, and I enjoyed making this one more than the East Asian Accordion. I especially enjoyed making folds with the bone folder and then taping folios together. I also appreciate that the spine is not rigid.
