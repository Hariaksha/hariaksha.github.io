Our first assignment for UH 223 was to create an East Asian Accordion. This book form has historical roots in China and Japan; it emerged roughly during the Tang Dynasty in China in the 7th-9th centuries. I found it very interesting how this book art largely developed as an alternative to scrolls, which were inconvenient for their length, lack of portability. and difficulty to store.

I found this type of book simple yet elegant, and I was happy when I saw my final product. I particularly enjoyed learning to use the Exacto knife and learning to make precise folds with my bone folder for the first time.

In the UH 223 lecture on the East Asian Accordion, I was fascinated by its historical roots in China and Japan, emerging roughly during the Tang Dynasty around the 7th-9th centuries as scrolls fell out of favor. Unlike Western codices, this concertina-style binding allowed continuous reading without ink bleeding issues, making it ideal for religious texts, poetry, and art. Creating one for our first assignment helped me appreciate its elegant simplicity and cultural significance. I particularly enjoyed experimenting with folds to mimic historical examples shown in class.
