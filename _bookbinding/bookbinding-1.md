Our first assignment for UH 223 was to create an East Asian Accordion. This book form has historical roots in China and Japan; it emerged roughly during the Tang Dynasty in China in the 7th-9th centuries. I found it very interesting how this book art largely developed as an alternative to scrolls, which were inconvenient for their length, lack of portability. and difficulty to store.

I found this type of book simple yet elegant, and I was happy when I saw my final product. I particularly enjoyed learning to use the Exacto knife and learning to make precise folds with my bone folder for the first time.
