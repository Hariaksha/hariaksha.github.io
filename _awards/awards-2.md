The Gilman Scholarship is an award, funded by the United States Department of State, to support undergraduates with limited financial means to study and/or intern abroad. I received this scholarship, along with the STEM Supplemental Award, to fund research at the Paderborn Research Center for Sustainable Economy (PARSEC) in Summer 2025.
