The Boren Scholarship is an award, funded by the National Security Education Program (NSEP), to support undergraduates to study less commonly taught languages in regions critical to United States interests. I received this scholarship in April 2024, and it supported me while I studied in UW-Madison's Southeast Asian Summer Studies Institute (SEASSI) in Summer 2024, studied in the Southeast Asian Flagship Language Initiative (SEAFL) at Universitas Negeri Malang in Fall 2024, and interned at Yayasan Planet Indonesia in Pontianak, West Kalimantan in Spring 2025.
