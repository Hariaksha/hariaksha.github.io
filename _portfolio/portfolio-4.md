As a Research Assistant at the University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Business, I conduct research into public sentiment regarding climate disasters, such as floods, tsunamis, and hurricanes. 

We use a dataset of climate disasters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; then we find multiple online news articles about each climate disaster. 

Using NLP, we will find out to what extent climate disasters are attributed to climate change versus randomness and natural causes. We will see how trends change based on type of climate disaster, state/geography, reporting organization, and other factors. 

This research has applications in determining public opinion about climate change and natural disasters, and it can therefore be used for public policy development. Policymakers can use the findings to identify how attribution of disasters to climate change differs across regions and political contexts, helping design communication strategies that foster greater consensus around climate action. This research can also support journalists, educators, and advocacy organizations by providing insights into how media frames climate-related events and influences public perception.
