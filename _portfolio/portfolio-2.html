As a Research Assistant at the University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Business, I conduct research into economics of charity. 
Specifically, using a dataset of financial information (revenue, assets, etc) and mission statements for hundreds of thousands of tax-exempt organizations in the United States, I use natural language processing and machine learning to understand what linguistic factors motivate individuals to give charitable donations.
